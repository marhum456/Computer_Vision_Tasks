# Computer-Vision-Tasks

## üìã Project Overview
This repository contains two image processing tasks completed as academic coursework. The tasks demonstrate different techniques for processing images such as edge detection and thresholding.

1. **Task 1:** Image thresholding and connected components analysis using OpenCV
2. **Task 2:** Edge detection using Sobel, Prewitt, and Roberts operators

The primary goal is to explore different methods for image processing, enhancing the understanding of these techniques and their applications in various fields.

## Projects in Detail

### üîç Task 1: Image Thresholding and Connected Components
- **Objective:** To classify distinct areas in an image using thresholding and connected components analysis.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Load and convert the image to grayscale.
  - Calculate the average grayscale value of the image.
  - Apply binary thresholding based on the average grayscale value.
  - Perform connected component analysis to count the number of distinct areas.
- **Results:** The task demonstrates how to segment an image and identify individual regions of interest.

### üñºÔ∏è Task 2: Edge Detection with Sobel, Prewitt, and Roberts Operators
- **Objective:** To detect edges in an image using three different edge detection operators: Sobel, Prewitt, and Roberts.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Load and convert the image to grayscale.
  - Apply Sobel, Prewitt, and Roberts edge detection filters.
  - Display the gradient magnitudes and directions for each operator.
- **Results:** This task highlights how edge detection helps in identifying boundaries and structures within an image.
