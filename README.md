# Computer-Vision-Tasks

## üìã Project Overview
This repository contains three image processing tasks completed as academic coursework. The tasks demonstrate different techniques for processing images such as smoothing, edge detection, and thresholding.

1. **Task 1:** Image thresholding and connected components analysis using OpenCV
2. **Task 2:** Image smoothing with various kernel sizes (3x3, 5x5, 7x7, etc.)
3. **Task 3:** Edge detection using Sobel, Prewitt, and Roberts operators

The primary goal is to explore different methods for image processing, enhancing the understanding of these techniques and their applications in various fields.

## Projects in Detail

### üîç Task 1: Image Thresholding and Connected Components
- **Objective:** To classify distinct areas in an image using thresholding and connected components analysis.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Load and convert the image to grayscale.
  - Calculate the average grayscale value of the image.
  - Apply binary thresholding based on the average grayscale value.
  - Perform connected component analysis to count the number of distinct areas.
- **Results:** The task demonstrates how to segment an image and identify individual regions of interest.

### üßπ Task 2: Image Smoothing
- **Objective:** To apply different smoothing filters (3x3, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9) to an image and observe the effects.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Load and convert the image to grayscale.
  - Apply various smoothing filters (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).
  - Display the original image alongside the smoothed images for comparison.
- **Results:** This task showcases how smoothing filters reduce noise and detail in an image.

### üñºÔ∏è Task 3: Edge Detection with Sobel, Prewitt, and Roberts Operators
- **Objective:** To detect edges in an image using three different edge detection operators: Sobel, Prewitt, and Roberts.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Load and convert the image to grayscale.
  - Apply Sobel, Prewitt, and Roberts edge detection filters.
  - Display the gradient magnitudes and directions for each operator.
- **Results:** This task highlights how edge detection helps in identifying boundaries and structures within an image.
